# Rationale

I wanted to create a multi page static web-site for "The Godfatherz" band that could list upcoming events , give contact details for the band , give the apperance of taking bookings & give information about the members and their social media outlets.

# Design 

In terms of the overall look and feel of the site, I wanted it to be fairly simple but effective. I used the exact same Bootstrap jumbotron theme on each of my pages, quite deliberately to keep the same flow and rough design on each page as to offer a hopefully uninterrupted and seemless experiance to the potential end user, keeping in mind the UX & UI consept of "Dont Make Me Think" keeping all Booking buttons and links in plane sight and easy to find.

I did consider using a slightly more flashy bootstrap theme just to spice up the project witch I have since accomplished in the "The-Godfatherz-MK2" (personal project on my GitHub Profile) , but decided to submit and go with my first design in the end as I considered it more of a learning curve in the initial stages.

As I wanted all of the pages/links ( including Social Media ) to be easily accessiable and easy to find, I embedded links into a lot of the text and the social media Logos will take you directly to thier revelent pages (FB Logo will take you to FB etc...).
